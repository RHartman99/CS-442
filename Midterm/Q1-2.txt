Question 1: For this ER diagram, what is the key of the Enrolled table?

Ans:        (sID, cID)

Question 2: Write down the key of the table that corresponds to the aggregate
            relationship E. If there are any conflicting attribute names, rename
            them something appropriate and easy to understand.
            
Ans:        (A_F, H, D_F, J). Since A and D have duplicate attribute names, I had
            to rename them to <ENTITY SET NAME>_<ATTRIBUTE NAME>


1: (sID, cID)
2: (F_A, H, J, F_D
